RewriteEngine On

# 1. Allow existing files and directories to be served normally
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]

# 2. Redirect everything else (including /api) to your Node application
# Note: Hostinger Node apps usually listen on a dynamic port proxied by the server
# This rule ensures that if it's not a real file, Express handles it.
